zrc		- example config file to placed under $HOME/.zrc or /etc/zrc
z   		- general wrapper
z.complete	- provide completetion service, put under /etc/bash_completion.d

General syntax

z <func> <obj> <--filter|--search|--data> [key=val,key=val...] [options]


FUNC
	Func is the name of operation you want to preform, avaliable operations
	you can see with 

	z [TAB][TAB]


OBJ
	Obj is the name of object of FUNC, avaliable objects with current FUNC

	z <func> [TAB][TAB]


General filtering
	Depending on selected func you can use --filter or --search or --data
	keyword to define array of parameters for selected FUNC
	You can use [TAB] to get reasonable keys to define for selected FUNC

	EXAMPLE: get details on host with name "zabbix"
	z get host --filter host=zabbix

Options
	There are many of them.
	Most of avaliable options passed directly to zabbix_api. Some useful 
	options described here.

	--show <list>
	By default script will display output in json tree format. With this
	define comma separated list of fields to output only selected fields.

	--limit <num>
	Select not more than <num> objects.


Some examples
	Assume we want to disable "Cron not running" trigger on host "zabbix"
	First we need triggerid of this trigger

	z get trigger --filter host=zabbix --search description=Cron \
	--show description,status,value,triggerid

	Return for me:

		status = 0
		description = Cron not running
		value = 1
		triggerid = 7411

	status=0 mean trigger enabled and value=1 mean trigger is active
	now set status=1 to disable trigger

	z update trigger --data triggerid=7411,status=1
	Return for me:

		{
		  "triggerids": [
		    "7411"
		  ]
		}

	Done.

TODO
	- Not supported usermacro for now in case of outdated api.
	- Not supported discovery
	- Not supported mass-update, use bash cickles
